class Box {
   public:
      double length;      // Length of a box
      double breadth;     // Breadth of a box
      double height;      // Height of a box
   
      double getVolume(void) {
         return length * breadth * height;
      }
};
If you like, you can define the same function outside the class using the scope resolution operator (::) as follows −

double Box::getVolume(void) {
   return length * breadth * height;
}
Here, only important point is that you would have to use class name just before :: operator. A member function will be called using a dot operator (.) on a object where it will manipulate data related to that object only as follows −

Box myBox;          // Create an object

myBox.getVolume();  // Call member function for the object
